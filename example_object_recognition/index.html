        The Method

        <p>
            By implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained to recognise various problems that
            manifest visually on a plant the user’s problem picture can be analysed and remedies can be recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
            CNNs are a supervised machine learning solution that are trained using input data that is classified
            according to type. In this case the different type classes would be the different diseases that a plant
            might suffer from. By inputting images of each possible disease type the CNN can ‘learn’ how to tell which
            one is by extracting the ‘features’ of the disease. Features are detected by the CNN passing a filter over
            the image.
        </p>

        <p>
            These filters are designed to detect specific features like edges, textures, or colours. During the
            convolution operation of the CNN, the filters move across the input data, performing element-wise
            multiplications and aggregating the results through summation. This process enables the CNN to identify
            local patterns and capture spatial dependencies within the data. As these convolutional layers are stacked,
            higher-level filters emerge, detecting more complex and abstract features.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pooling layers reduce the resolution of the feature maps while retaining the most relevant information.
            Pooling helps to make the CNN more robust to variations in position and scale, allowing it to focus on the
            essential features.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the CNN has extracted the features through the convolutional and pooling layers, the fully connected
            layers are responsible for converting these features into a format suitable for making classifications. The
            fully connected layers act as a classifier by applying a series of linear transformations and non-linear
            activation functions to the input data. These functions convert the raw output values into probabilities and
            these probabilities represent the likelihood of the input belonging to each class. The class with the
            highest probability is considered the predicted class for the input.
