        <p>
            So much is talked about Artificial Intelligence (AI) currently that it is difficult to assess if this collection of technologies can be useful, 
            or if it's  just another boom to bust gimmick. We’ve been through the crypto and blockchain technology lifecycles - and while they have their uses, 
            they are not ubiquitously useful and sometimes they’re a king’s clothes scam. Remember NTFs?
        </p>
        <p>
            But Steve and Nick think AI is different and that’s because we feel the term AI is a bit of a misnomer. AI is, for all intents and purposes, 
            clever data processing and pattern recognition. We are not techbros, we do not evangelise, 
            we have studied this science from an academic point of view and we approach its application with the same pragmatism. 
            Now we want to help you to understand if leveraging these technologies can help your business and bring your ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are involved in running an organisation and you feel you might be missing out on the benefits of AI because you don’t have the 
            in-house skills or maybe you have an idea but you don’t know where to start then we can help. We are a cost effective solution for discovery, 
            prototyping and implementation. We will tell you honestly if we don’t think it’s worth your investment right now, otherwise we will give 
            you a range of options and if you like, build you a prototype.
        </p>
        <P>
            If the prototype works and you feel it will improve your product, service or bottom line then we can scale it and integrate it. 
            We’re happy to work with your in-house technology teams or on our own - it’s what we’ve been doing for more than two decades as IT professionals. 
        </P>
